While some of them are definitely good advice, one will, at some point, find rules that are contradictory, and there are rules vehemently believed by one author while loathed by another.</p><p>After reading many of these so-called rules, one has to admit that there are actually no rules. In fact, I believe that great artworks in all art forms are great because they have broken rules one way or another. Imagine Ludwig van Beethoven did not add a final chorus in his ninth symphony, his ninth symphony would be just another symphony, not one that changed music history. Likewise, novels such as those written by James Joyce and Marcel Proust would probably be regarded by some as serious offenders of many of the rules set out by many contemporary writers, but that do not diminish the importance of their works.</p><p>So I am not here to write another “10 rules for creating a character,” “5 rules for writing better sentences,” or “how to create conflict.” That is not to say that those guides are completely useless, and I am sure that I am indebted to some of the writers of those guides. What I am going to do here is to document my writing processes for the two novels that I have worked on, and the one that I did not finish writing.</p><p id="toc"><em>Table of Contents</em></p><ul id="markdown-toc"><li><a href="#novels" id="markdown-toc-novels">Novels</a><ul><li><a href="#the-unfinished-novel" id="markdown-toc-the-unfinished-novel">The Unfinished Novel</a></li><li><a href="#only-you-know-what-it-means" id="markdown-toc-only-you-know-what-it-means">Only You Know What It Means</a></li><li><a href="#twenty-forty-seven" id="markdown-toc-twenty-forty-seven">Twenty Forty-Seven</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#on-note-taking" id="markdown-toc-on-note-taking">On note-taking</a></li><li><a href="#the-writing-routine" id="markdown-toc-the-writing-routine">The writing routine</a></li></ul><p /><h2 id="novels">Novels</h2><h3 id="the-unfinished-novel">The Unfinished Novel</h3><p>While this was not the first novel I have attempted to write (I tried when I was a kid, and it did not work out), this was my first serious effort. I forced myself to write about a thousand words every day; sometimes I succeeded, sometimes I could not find the time to do so, and sometimes I just failed. After a few months of working on this novel, I was about 50,000 words into it. And then I stopped, because the story did not work.</p><p><small><a href="#toc">Up to table of contents</a></small></p><h3 id="only-you-know-what-it-means">Only You Know What It Means</h3><p><a href="/novels/only-you-know-what-it-means/">Only You Know What It Means</a> was born out of my random scrawling while my first seriout attempt to write a novel stalled. Since I was unable to add anthing to my unfinished work, I randomly typed a few sentences onto my computer, and from there I wrote tens of pages very quickly. The pace of my writing of this novel persuaded me to abandon the first attempt.</p><p><a href="/novels/only-you-know-what-it-means/">Only You Know What It Means</a> is a literary novel about an orchestral conductor, in which I explore the questions of choices in life and how our decisions and the decisions made for us by our families and societies alter the courses of our lives, sometimes in big and harmful ways. The (working) title of the novel is a quote from Gustav Mahler’s tenth Symphony: in the manuscript, Mahler wrote “Du allein weisst was es bedeutet,” implying that only Alma, his wife, could understand what he wrote. Being a classical music fan and an orchestral music buff, I enjoyed writing this novel very much, and I did finish the first drafts relatively quickly.</p><p>While I do not intend to formulate rules for writing novels, the experience of writing this novel tells me one thing: if a story works, one can finish the first draft relatively quickly.</p><p>Of course, finishing the early drafts with ease also means that it requires substantial revision. After finishing the first draft of this novel, I put it aside for a long time while working on the next project. Now that the next project to coming to a close, I am finally returning to it.</p><p><small><a href="#toc">Up to table of contents</a></small></p><h3 id="twenty-forty-seven">Twenty Forty-Seven</h3><p>For the uninitiated, the year <a href="/novels/2047/">2047</a> means very little. But for people in Hong Kong, the year 2047 will be the year in which the so-called “One country, Two Systems” arrangement ends. I have been meaning to write something related to Hong Kong for a while, but I have yet been able to settle on a historical setting in which I can base a narrative on. For a long time, I was researching the 1967 Riots, hoping to set a story in that era. Unfortunately, I ended the research empty-handed.</p><p>As a fan of Kazuo Ishiguro, I have been influenced by his way of using elements of science fiction in <em>Never Let Me Go</em> to explore big issues in our lives (i.e. Love) without letting the sci-fi elements dominating the story. To varying degrees, works such as <em>Ninteen Eighty-Four</em> by George Orwell and <em>Handmaid’s Tale</em> by Margaret Atwood also make use of a certain sci-fi elements without reading like science fiction novels like the works of Philip K. Dick (make no mistake though: I do like Philip K. Dick). From that, my idea of setting the story in that not-too-distant took shape.</p><p>The writing of <a href="/novels/2047/">Twenty Forty-Seven</a> coincided with the leading up to the Occupy Central Protests, which were later more commonly known as the <em>Umbrella Revolution</em>. As I finished the first draft of this novel, the protests erupted, and tear gas was fired at unarmed protesters. All of a sudden, the world described in <em>Ninteen Eighty-Four</em> became the reality as I saw it, and still see.</p><p>This novel was the first one I wrote in longhand with fountain pens. The easy flow of ideas from my mind to a piece of paper is something I have not experienced while working on a computer. I also like the fact that writing in longhand means I can stay away from my computer and avoid distractions. Although finishing the early drafts within a short period of time is indeed, to me at least, an indication of whether the narrative works, there is one disadvantage. Quick progress in the early stages means heavier editing in later stages. Like <a href="/novels/only-you-know-what-it-means/">Only You Know What It Means</a>, I finished the first draft of this novel in a relatively short period of time, but I have made many rounds of revisions since the first draft was completed, which have taken me almost a year, on and off.</p><p><small><a href="#toc">Up to table of contents</a></small></p><h2 id="on-note-taking">On note-taking</h2><p>I do not carry a notebook around to jot down ideas. If I were to make up a rule here, I would say that the ideas that work are those that stay in my mind. Since they stay in my mind, it does not matter whether I jot them down or not.</p><p><small><a href="#toc">Up to table of contents</a></small></p><h2 id="the-writing-routine">The writing routine</h2><p>When I write a draft, I write every day, with only a few exceptions. In general, I can write anywhere between 3,000 to 5,000 words a day. It usually takes one and a half month to two months of intensive work (day-offs and time wasted on watching cat videos included) to complete the first draft of an average-lengthed novel. I then put the draft aside for days, sometimes weeks, during which I rest and read.</p><p><small><a href="#toc">Up to table of contents</a></small></p><div></div></div></div></div></section><footer data-anchor="footer" class="section text-center"><div class="container"><div class="row"><p><ul class="list-inline banner-social-buttons"><li> <a href="https://twitter.com/peterychuang" class="btn btn-circle btn-lg pagescroll" title="Twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter animated"></i> <span class="network-name"></span></a></li><li> <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PeterYuChuang/" class="btn btn-circle btn-lg pagescroll" title="Google+"><i class="fa fa-google-plus animated"></i> <span class="network-name"></span></a></li></li><li> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PeterYChuangWrite" class="btn btn-circle btn-lg pagescroll" title="Facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook animated"></i> <span class="network-name"></span></a></li></li><li> <a href="https://instagram.com/peterychuang" class="btn btn-circle btn-lg pagescroll" title="Instagram"><i class="fa fa-instagram animated"></i> <span class="network-name"></span></a></li></li><li> <a href="https://medium.com/@peterychuang" class="btn btn-circle btn-lg pagescroll" title="Medium"><i class="fa fa-medium animated"></i> <span class="network-name"></span></a></li></ul></p><p><small>Copyright &copy; 2015</small></p></div></div></footer></div><script src="/assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/jquery.easing.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/grayscale.js"></script></body></html>
